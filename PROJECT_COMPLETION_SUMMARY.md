## Impact Statement

This work demonstrates how proper tooling can transform hyperparameter tuning from a computational barrier into an accessible, systematic practice. By addressing real pain points identified by the mixOmics community and providing practical, runnable solutions, we've created resources that will improve the statistical rigor and reproducibility of biological research.

The combination of technical excellence, educational clarity, and practical utility positions this work to have meaningful impact on how researchers approach statistical modeling in the biological sciences.

**Key Message**: Good tools enable good science. By making sophisticated statistical methods accessible, we democratize scientific excellence and enable researchers to focus on biological discovery rather than computational mechanics.
