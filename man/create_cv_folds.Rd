\usage{
create_cv_folds(Y, nfolds = 5, stratified = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Response variable (factor for classification, numeric for regression)}

\item{nfolds}{Number of cross-validation folds (integer > 1)}

\item{stratified}{Logical, whether to use stratified sampling for factors}
}
\value{
List of numeric vectors, each containing indices for a fold
}
\description{
Internal functions for performing N-fold cross-validation with support for
stratified sampling and flexible evaluation metrics.

\details{
Create Cross-Validation Folds

Creates N-fold cross-validation folds with optional stratified sampling
for classification problems.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Classification with stratified sampling
Y <- factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10))
folds <- create_cv_folds(Y, nfolds = 5, stratified = TRUE)

# Regression without stratification
Y <- rnorm(20)
folds <- create_cv_folds(Y, nfolds = 4, stratified = FALSE)
}
